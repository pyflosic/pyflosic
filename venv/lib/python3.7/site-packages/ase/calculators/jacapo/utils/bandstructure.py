        atoms is an ase.Atoms object with calculator
        attached. Presumably the self-consistent charge density has
        already been calculated, otherwise, it will be.

        BZpath is a list of tuples describing the path through the
        Brillouin zone. The tuples have the form (label, kpt), e.g. ::

          [('$\Gamma$',[0.0, 0.0, 0.0]),
           ('X',[0.0, 0.5, 0.5]),
           ('L',[0.5, 0.0, 0.0]),
           ('$\Gamma$',[0.0, 0.0, 0.0])]

        the label is used in the figure and can include latex markup.

        npoints is the number of points on each segment. It can either
        be a constant, which is used for every segment, or a list of
        integers that is an integer for each segment.
