# This example shows how magnetic coupling constants can be calculated with FLO-SIC. 
# As we have to apply an electric field and calculate J twice during this example, it makes sense to do that with a separate function.
# In order to calculate the magnetic coupling constant we need to calculate the broken symmetry solution for E_(LS).
# This is done by applying an electric field. Once that has been done, it is easy to calculate the coupling constant.
